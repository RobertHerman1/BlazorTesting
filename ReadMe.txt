This project is my attempt at understanding the basics of Blazor, how to use it, what it looks like, and solving simple problems using the technology. 

I also used this project to obtain docker experience, creating a container here, exporting it to DockerHub, then deploying that to a different computer (laptop) and confirming the site worked as expected there (it did!)



To run this website, open powershell and execute these two commands. For the first command, substitute the folderpath this text file is in. 

cd C:\Users\Owner\Documents\GitHub\BlazorTesting

dotnet run

Then, note the localhost in the output, for example http://localhost:1234/  
Copy+paste that URL into a local file. The website should run.
